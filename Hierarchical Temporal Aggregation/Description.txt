Temporal Aggregation: Divide the input sequence into non-overlapping, equally-sized segments. For each segment, compute an aggregated representation that captures the most salient information.

Hierarchical Model Training: Train a hierarchical AI model that learns to process the aggregated representations from step 1. The model should be designed with multiple levels, where each level operates at a different time scale, allowing the model to capture both local and global patterns in the data.

Inference Scaling: During inference, the hierarchical model can quickly process the aggregated representations, reducing the required computations as the sequence length increases. This enables more efficient scaling of inference with longer sequences.

Reverse Mapping: Implement a reverse mapping process to transform the model's output back to the original sequence length. This allows for the generation of predictions at the same granularity as the input data.

Evaluation and Iteration: Evaluate the performance of the hierarchical model using standard evaluation metrics. If necessary, repeat steps 1-4 with different aggregation schemes, model architectures, or reverse mapping techniques to improve the model's performance.
